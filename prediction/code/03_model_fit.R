# mathematical description of the model:
# The model can be described mathematically as follows: ------ TO BE ADJUSTED

#                   for s in 1:N_species ...
#                  for t in 1:N_timepoints...

#                   ## Observation model ##
#  Relative abundance[s, t] ~ Beta(μ[s, t], φ[s])

#                   ## Linear predictor ##           ------ WE TAKE OUT ? (OU JUSTE PARTIE AVEC MINTEMP)
#            logit(μ[s, t]) = α[s] + f(mintemp)_shared[t] +
#                             f(mintemp)_species[s, t]
#                         f = sum(β_smooth * b)

#                      ## Priors ##
#                         α ~ Normal(μ_population, σ_population)
#              μ_population ~ Normal(0, 1)
#              σ_population ~ Student-t(3, 0, 2.5)[0, ] ------ TO BE ADJUSTED?
#                  β_smooth ~ MVNormal(0, (Ω ∗ λ)^−1)
#                         λ ~ Normal(5, 30)[0, ]
#                         φ ~ Gamma(0.01, 0.01)

# where:  ------------------------------------- TO BE ADJUSTED
# f are the penalized smooth functions
# b are thin plate spline basis functions
# Ω are a set of prior precision matrices for the smooths
# λ are the smoothing penalties that prevent overfitting; note that
#   Normal(5, 30)[0, ] indicates a half-normal prior distribution
# φ are species-level precision parameters


# If you would like to see the underlying Stan code, which is fully
# transparent in its use of prior distributions, use the code()
